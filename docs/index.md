Miles is a high-performance, enterprise-ready reinforcement learning (RL) framework specifically optimized for **Large-Scale model Post-Training**. It
couples [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) for high-throughput rollout with
[Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) for scalable training, and ships the precision, stability, and observability features
needed to run RL at trillion-parameter scale.


*"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single rollout."* — Miles focuses on the low-level system optimizations that make large-scale RL stable, efficient, and reproducible.

## Core features

### Efficiency & stability

- **Fully async RL.** Rollout and training workers are decoupled, with configurable
  on- and off-policy schedules, an optimized pipeline with fewer bubbles, and
  customizable async rollout and eval modes. See
  [Fully Async Rollout](/user-guide/fully-async).
- **Fast agentic rollout.** High-throughput generation on
  [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), optimized for multi-turn
  agentic workloads.
- **Fast weight updates.** Updated weights sync back in-loop without pausing
  rollout — under 10 seconds for a model with 1 T parameters — with
  [P2P RDMA](/advanced/p2p-weight-transfer) as a fast path for disaggregated setups.
- **Unified low-precision training.** [MXFP8 and NVFP4](/advanced/fp8-low-precision)
  training with a numerically stable RL recipe that reduces precision-induced
  divergence; FP8, [INT4 QAT](/advanced/int4-qat), BF16, and FP16 are also supported.
- **Token-in-token-out (TITO).** Supported for
  [all models and all black-box agent harnesses](/user-guide/agentic-chat-template) —
  no detokenize/retokenize round-trips between rollout and training.
- **Rollout Routing Replay (R3).** Expert routing recorded during rollout is
  [replayed in the trainer's forward pass](/advanced/miles-router), eliminating the
  routing mismatch that destabilizes large-scale MoE RL, with compute and
  communication overlapped to minimize overhead.
- **LoRA and multi-LoRA.** [Low-rank adapters](/advanced/lora) train frontier-scale
  models on a fraction of the GPUs, and the same adapters load directly into SGLang
  for rollout — no separate merge or conversion step.
- **Fault tolerance.** When an SGLang engine dies, Miles
  [recovers it and resumes the run in place](/advanced/fault-tolerance) — no
  restart, no pause.
- **Day-0 model support.** Day-0 enablement of frontier releases such as
  DeepSeek-V4, Kimi-K3, GLM-5.2, Inkling, and Nemotron — and beyond day-0, nearly
  all frontier models (see [Supported models](#supported-models)).

### Design, support & user experience

- **Coding-agent sandboxes and examples.** [Harbor](/user-guide/harbor),
  [OpenEnv](/user-guide/openenv), and [NeMo-Gym](/user-guide/nemo-gym) integrations,
  running local CPU sandboxes or per-episode sandboxes on
  [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/), [E2B](https://e2b.dev/), and self-hosted
  [AgentENV](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/AgentENV) — see
  [Environments](/user-guide/environments) for the support matrix.
- **Highly customizable pipeline.** Shape every workload through
  [twenty-plus plug-points](/user-guide/customization), from reward computation to
  the full rollout function.
- **Megatron or FSDP.**
  [Switch training backends](/developer/experimental-features#fsdp-backend) without
  rewriting your training loop.
- **Wide recipe support.** RL (GRPO, PPO), SFT, and on-policy distillation.
- **Verified on multiple hardware generations.** GB300, GB200, B300, B200, H200,
  H100, and AMD MI355X / MI300X — see [Platforms](/platforms/index).
- **Comprehensive CI.** Unit suites run on every pull request, and tag-triggered
  end-to-end GPU training tests cover the supported model families on both NVIDIA
  and AMD runners.
- **[Miles dashboard](/user-guide/dashboard).** A self-hosted web UI for a run's
  training dynamics and compute efficiency: what every GPU was doing during a step,
  and what each trajectory contained at the token level.
